# Semantic Checks Brainstorm
Just some basic semantic checks that are worth performing

* Identifier (var/func name) can't be reserved word
* Only non-void functions in expressions, only void functions in statements
* Undefined variables and functions can't be referenced (?)
    * Builtin functions come pre-populated
* Function w/ same name can't be defined twice
* Function is called w/ required number of arguments
